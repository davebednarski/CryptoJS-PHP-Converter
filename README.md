## Description
Occasionally there is a time where you have sensitive data...but not that sensitive :)  
It's data that could be viewable if you start sniffing around casually and you're looking to prevent that.

With that said, here's a take on securing data to and from client and server as well as store it encrypted on the client.

Using AES encryption here, but could be any symmetric encryption type such as DES, Blowfish, Twofish, RC6, etc.
